Our sync protocol is simillar to the client protocol. It again uses txt messages,
but each message is prefixed with SYNC_. For example, we have SYNC_WRITE, SYNC_REPLACE,
SYNC_ABORT, SYNC_ON and SYNC_OFF.

  Each message reply is ACK or NACK, depending on the return value of sent command.

  This is the sequence of synchronization commands:
  SYNC_ON
  SYNC_WRITE | SYNC_REPLACE
  SYNC_OFF | SYNC_ABORT

  The originating server, creates the text messagem and send it to each peer. Then it loops,
until timeout, or until he has received ACK/NACK responses, from all.
